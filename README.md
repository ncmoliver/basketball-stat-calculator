## üíº Overview

The basketball calculator was designed to analzye, display, and synthesize with basketball statistics. My belief is that statistics tell more of a story than we give it credit to, only when even single fact is accounted for. There are limited statistic shown on a single game basketball statistic. Taking this data and creating additional variables that are implied, yet based on facts to give to an AI model to begin telling more of the unseen story behind basketball.
This is our goal. Our goal is to delve a little deeper below the surface with each model. For example, our initial goal is to accurately calculate hustle. Hustle is a critical and useful feature in a player in basketball, however our definitive goal is to be able to determine how much of that husltle is being used in useful areas and how much is waste. The goal is to push each model to be more and more precise around the unseen areas in basketball.
